# IE211 Probability Teamwork 3

## Project Title and Description
This repository contains simulations to demonstrate key probability concepts:
- **SLLN (Strong Law of Large Numbers):** Shows that the sample mean of U[0,1] converges to its expected value (0.5).
- **CLT (Central Limit Theorem):** Shows that standardized sums approach a standard normal distribution as n increases.
- **Monte Carlo Pi Estimation:** Estimates π using random points in the unit square.

All generated plots are saved under `results/figures/`.
